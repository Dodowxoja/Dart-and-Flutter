--- Object Oriented Programming - Fundamental Concepts ---

To create a objects programmatically you need a Class.
A Class is a template for creating objects. A Class
is a code written by programmer to define the attributes 
and the operations of an object, attributes describe the
object. They're sometimes referred to fields, because they
contain data. Operations are behaviors of object and more commonly 
they're known as methods. Objects are instance of a class in the
computer's memory

The four fundamental concepts of OOP are
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

Before considering what they mean first consider what is an Object.
An Object is a thing from the real world
A thing that you want to store and process data about
Another name for an object is an entity.

Abstraction means to simplify reality and focus only on the data and
processes relevant to the application being built

Encapsulation is hiding data and complexity 

Inheritance is a class can derive its methods and properties from another 
class, resulting in a hierarchy of classes

Polymorphism is a class can implement an inherited method in its own way.
(Polymorphism literally means many forms). Different subclasses of the same
superclass, can implement their shared interface in different ways.
